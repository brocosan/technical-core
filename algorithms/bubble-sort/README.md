# Bubble sort

## Description
Sorts data by comparing each element of the array to its neighbor and then swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This gives the visual effect of the larger elements “bubbling” to the end of the array.

The algorithm will iterate through an array multiple times until the elements are in the correct order.

Bubble sort can perform poorly when working with a lot of elements, making it primarily used as simply an educational tool.
