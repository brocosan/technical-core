# Insertion sort

## Description
Sorts data by going through each element in the array and inserting that item into the already sorted portion of the array.
Works like sorting a deck of cards in hand. As you proceed through the elements of an array you would move it back until it is in the correct place.

- Work left to right
- Examine each element and compare it to elements on the left
- Insert the current element in the correct place

Simple and inefficient but considered like one of the best for small sequences of data.
