# Graph Search

Way of exploring a graph.  
A graph is typically traversed in two ways:
- [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](./BFS.md)
- [Depth-First Search (DFS)](./DFS.md)

## Comparison between the two
BFS starts visiting nodes from root while DFS starts visiting nodes from leaves. So if our problem is to search something that is more likely closer to root, we would prefer BFS. And if the target node is close to a leaf, we would prefer DFS.
